1. I want to use go Instead, because previously great brother Harvard told me ErLang with which RabbitMq was built is a great parallel
processing language, when I looked up, but found that ErLang is an Intepreted type, since Go is a newer and compiled language, and it seems 
it is not hard, I can go try using GoLang, together with react, they could pair very efficiently and make good web apps!

2. I am already bored with many of the programming languages that I have ever tried with, they bring me no happiness, I am eager for products
now, and at the same time, using new programming language could contribute to my pleasure by giving me some fresh entertainment.

3. I have found an GOLang online doc that is in Chinese, and explains it seemingly thoroughly. the address of the index is
[GOLangDOc](http://c.biancheng.net/golang/concurrent/)
4. I am to try it tonight and at least download it and try some of the basic grammarly flow control and some keywords.
5. The first package of GO is very important the **"fmt"** package, which is the format package in GO, which can print the strings in certain format

6. I think of creating an architecure diagram of the goLang app structure, and mark every part with the coressponding flow control phrases, like an architecture show, diagrams help remember better, and makes better memory.

>> My handtyping articles do not look so ugly especially when I go read them in a distance from the screen, though my life has passed much, and though the morning sun never lasts a day, this skill should last forever, this language in my brain!
>> 我曾经想过多次,有一个想法在脑里,哪一天,一定要用英语写一本记录自己生平的书,语言要流畅一点,诙谐也好,幽默也好,就是不要就那么死板地成了一个没有生机的死板. 这样写下去或者能够将长时间的思绪连接成一个完整的故事, 日积月累.
>> I always had wanted to write a book in English, and some day put this long paragraphs together into a note which can be thick enough to be called a book, which records the life time of my existance. I love expressing so much.
